# WDI Project 2
## Edit My Story by Catherine Gracey

### Technical Requirements

**1** **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app

**2** **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow

**3** **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

**4** **Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure** and interact with your relationally-stored data

**5** **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process

**6** Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**

**7** **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

This project, Edit My Story, is hosted online by Heroku at https://editmystory.herokuapp.com/.

### Necessary Deliverables

**1** A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet

This project is written with Embedded Ruby and CSS for the front end, served by a Ruby server, and supported by a SQL database. It is hosted online at Heroku.

**2** A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo

The relevant section directs users to the Heroku page.

**3** A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.

The repository for this project is available on GitHub at https://github.com/CatherineGracey/editmystory.

**4** **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

**5** **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme

All Wireframes are hosted on Google Drive at https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwufuHnAOTjGUE5NcGpvVHhhTXM.

**6** A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publically-accessible **user stories you created**

User stories and other project notes are availabe on Trello at https://trello.com/b/LuBupmgJ/edit-my-story.
